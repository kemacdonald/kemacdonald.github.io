I am a Postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Communications](https://comm.ucla.edu/)
at the University of California, Los Angeles where I work with Anne S. Warlaumont
in the [Emergence of Communication Lab](https://www.annewarlaumont.org/). I completed my PhD
at Stanford University, working with [Michael Frank](https://www.stanford.edu/~mcfrank/) in the
[Language and Cognition Lab](https://langcog.stanford.edu/0) and Anne Fernald and Virginia Marchman in
the [Language Learning Lab](https://web.stanford.edu/group/langlearninglab/).


My [research](publications/) aims to understand what makes children such powerful learners. The guiding hypothesis is that children are quite flexible, adapting their active information seeking  to take advantage of rich input within social learning environments. To understand how active and social learning come together, I use a combination of approaches including eye-tracking, web-based experiments, computational models, and analyses of large-scale, naturalistic datasets.
