I am a Research Scientist at McD Tech Labs working to develop artificial systems
that communicate using natural language. 

Before working at Tech Labs, I was a Postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Communications](https://comm.ucla.edu/)
at the University of California, Los Angeles where I worked with Anne S. Warlaumont
in the [Emergence of Communication Lab](https://www.annewarlaumont.org/). I completed my PhD
at Stanford University, working with [Michael Frank](https://www.stanford.edu/~mcfrank/) in the
[Language and Cognition Lab](https://langcog.stanford.edu/0) and with Anne Fernald and Virginia Marchman in
the [Language Learning Lab](https://web.stanford.edu/group/langlearninglab/).

<!-- My [research](publications/) aims to understand what makes humans such powerful learners. The guiding hypothesis is that people flexibly adapt their information seeking to leverage rich input available in social learning environments. I use a combination of approaches including eye-tracking, web-based experiments, computational models, and analyses of large-scale, naturalistic datasets.  -->
