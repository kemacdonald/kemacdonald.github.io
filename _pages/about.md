I am a Postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Communications](https://comm.ucla.edu/)
at the University of California, Los Angeles. I work with Anne S. Warlaumont
in the [Emergence of Communication Lab](https://www.annewarlaumont.org/). I completed my PhD
at Stanford where I worked with [Michael Frank](https://www.stanford.edu/~mcfrank/) in the
[Language and Cognition Lab](https://langcog.stanford.edu/0).

My [research](/al-folio/publications/) aims to understand what makes children such powerful learners, especially in the domain of early language acquisition. To answer this question, I use a combination of approaches including eye-tracking, web-based experiments, computational models, and analyses of large-scale naturalistic datasets.
